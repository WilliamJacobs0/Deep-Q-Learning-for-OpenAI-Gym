# Deep-Q-Learning-for-OpenAI-Gym

An implementation of reinforcement learning to navigate one of OpenAI's "Gym" environments, [CartPole](https://github.com/openai/gym/wiki/CartPole-v0). 

The agent uses Reinforcement Learning, implementing a deep neural network as the Q-Function approximator, to optimize performance in this environment  (to keep the pole upright for the longest amount of time). The general nature of this approach means that this agent could easily be adapted to other games and environments, which I intend to do in the future. 

I have also uploaded a presentation on Q-Learning in general and as applied to this problem, and how the use of deep learning is vital in allowing the Q-Learning approach to work in problem domains where the action-state space renders the traditional method of Q-Tables unfeasible.
